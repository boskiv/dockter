# Dockter

Dockter is in the early development stages of becoming a full-fletched IDE for Dockter. The project 
aims to simplify using Docker on your development machine and to visualize running containers. 

## Planned features

- Run any terminal command
- Open a folder containing a docker-compose.yml file as a Dockter project. In this project, 
you will be able to open the docker-compose file or Dockerfiles in a text-editor to make changes.
- Build the Docker project (docker-compose build)
- Run the Docker project (docker-compose up)
- Create a new Dockter project
- Create and edit Dockerfiles
- Run separate Dockerfiles
- Visually see your running containers/services
- Create networks
- Deploy Dockter projects
- Dockerfile and docker-compose syntax coloring
- Create and edit shell files
- Add git repositories to use as build folder in your Dockerfiles
